# CS50x 2019 Final Project

## Digit Recognizer

This is a small web application created for CS50x 2019 Final Project.
The main function of the app is handwritting digits classification.
The app allows the user to draw a single digit (0-9) on the canvas.
Then it tries to recognize this digit.
For recognition the app uses a pretrained neural network.
A convolutional neural network was made and pretrained for this project.
